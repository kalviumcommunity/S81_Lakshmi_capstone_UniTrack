Low-fidelity wireframes for UniTrack (Event & Attendance Capstone)

Files included (SVG wireframes):
- landing.svg — Event list / search / filters
- event_details.svg — Event details, registration, QR placeholder
- login.svg — Login / Google sign-in
- faculty_dashboard.svg — Faculty event creation + attendance tools
- attendance.svg — QR scanning and live attendance

How to import these into Figma
1. Open Figma and create a new file.
2. Drag-and-drop each `.svg` from this repo into the Figma canvas. Each SVG will import as vector shapes.
3. Convert imported shapes into frames if you want to organize screens: select the artboard and use `Frame selection`.
4. Add simple interactions in Prototype mode (e.g., click "Register" → open `event_details` frame).

Suggested edits to make this low-fi prototype interactive in Figma
- Turn the main rectangles into Frames and name them (Landing, Event Details, Login, Faculty Dashboard, Attendance).
- Add simple hotspots: Register button → Event Details; Generate QR → Attendance.
- Use Figma Text styles for headings and body copy.

Exporting from Figma
- When your low-fi frames are ready, use `File > Export > PDF` or export each frame as PNG to include in documentation.

Notes
- These designs are intentionally low-fidelity (wireframe-level) to meet the assignment requirement. Use Figma to iterate visually and add simple flows.
