Here's a detailed model for an Event Management and Attendance System for a University, including students' login, faculty login, and admin login. I'll also include additional features to make it more comprehensive.

2. Event Management:

Event creation, editing, and deletion.

Event categorization (workshops, cultural fests, technical events, etc.).

Capacity limits for each event.


3. Student Attendance System:

QR Code/Face Recognition for attendance marking.

Live attendance tracking for faculty and admin.


4. Event Registration & Participation:

Students can browse and register for upcoming events.

Confirmation emails and reminders.

Event feedback collection after participation.
